Letâ€™s assume you tried to install HS8 with a bad license. What will happen here is that the install will go through but fail at starting up hyperstore. 
You can also check the logs to confirm this.

HOW TO FIX

Get the correct license

Execute the cloudian install with the dash L switch 

./cloudianInstall.sh -l cloudian_Free_Trial_Object_Lock_Compatible-feb-14-2024.lic
use the hsctl command to apply the license 

hsctl config apply license
You can now start , restart etc the hyperstore service

 

In the future you will be able to use the 

hsctl config get / set / common.licenseFileName tool to do this


## How to check the existing license filename



[root@hs8 cloudian]# ls -l /etc/cloudian/license/
total 8
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 712 Dec 13 15:41 2023-12-13T154133_cloudian_Free_Trial_Object_Lock_Compatible-feb-14-2024.lic
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  98 Dec 13 15:41 cloudian_license.lic -> /etc/cloudian/license/2023-12-13T154133_cloudian_Free_Trial_Object_Lock_Compatible-feb-14-2024.lic

 

[root@hs7 7.5.3]# grep "CLOUDIAN_LICENSEFILE=" /opt/cloudian/bin/cloudian
