##These are my hints for customizing cloudian firewall

hsctl config get firewall

Notes
Firewall group name when applied to allow means only allow this group deny everything else with the exception of other hyperstore nodes
Firewall group name when applied to deny  means deny this group

1. Create the group name and set the ip values 
Create firewall group name ignore the name it really is list of addresses you want to apply
hsctl config create firewall.acl <group name>


Set ip address range for the group
hsctl config set firewall.acl.deny_list.addrs="192.168.0.80/32"


2. apply it to any of the default service targets that were already created for you
hsctl config set firewall.services.admin.main.https.allow=<group name>

3. For custom service/port you have to create the custom name and define the ports for the custom firewall service

hsctl config create firewall.services.custom sshonly
hsctl config set firewall.services.custom.sshonly.ports=tcp/22

4. Then you can apply the ip group from step 1 to the custom firewall service
hsctl config set firewall.services.custom.sshonly.allow=<group name>
